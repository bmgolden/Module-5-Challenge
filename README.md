# Module-5-Challenge
MatPlotLib Statistics Challenge 
Here is my submission for Module 5 challenge. My submission covers all aspects of the assignment, hopefully, in a very direct, succint way which satisfies all of the listed criteria. Submitted is a folder containing my Jupyter Notebook file and the necessary analysis. 

Thanks, 
Brendan Golden
